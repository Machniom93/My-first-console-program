# My first console program
I create this project after passing first level of course in CodersLab. \
This project brings together various skills from the basics of __Java programming__.
## What programme is that?
My program is kind of task manager.\
Program retrieves the task list from the file: "tasks.csv". Than you can perform some actions on the loaded file. \
After the program has finished the content of the file is changed to the current task list.\
Untill you don't enter word: _"exit"_ program is running.
## How it works?
You have four options to choose:
1) add - you will be pleased to give a details of new task. Than this task will be added to your list of tasks;
2) remove - you will have to provide a number of task wich you want to remove 
            (*so better, before you choose that option, select the option "list" to check what's number of task that you want remove*);
3) list - task list will be displayed;
4) exit - as you already know, the program will and.
